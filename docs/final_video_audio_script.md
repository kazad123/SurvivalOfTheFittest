*A Malmo Project for CompSci 175 at UC Irvine*

## Final Video Audio Script

### Introduction
Hello, everyone! Today we're going to introduce you our CS 175 AI Project based on Malmo Minecraft -- Survival of the Fittest. The ultimate goal of the agent is to survive as long as possible (in seconds). Our initial idea is to implement what we have learnt from previous Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning classes to construct a Malmo agent, who can dodge and survive under constant hostile attack by enemies, such as zombies, spiders, you name it!
